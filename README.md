# old fashioned Breaking Bad

# I developed aold fashioned breaking bad series fan website with react, redux and router
### `npm i @reduxjs/toolkit`
### `npm i react-router-dom`
# I used axios to get the data.
### `npm i axios`
# I used Masonry css library
### `npm i Masonry`

## About my app
There is a button at the bottom of our page to load more content until the data runs out. user clicks the button to switch to a new page and gets below the content as there is more content.

When the data is finished, the button disappears and instead of the give button, it warns the user that there is no more content left.

If the user clicks on the content he wants to learn information about, he will only find new information about that content.
